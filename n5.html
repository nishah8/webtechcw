            <p> Good choice! You climb on the triceratops and direct him to flee. He runs away with you on the top and you reach and beautiful clearing on a height. You can see beautiful lush green 
                forests. You spend some time with your new dino friend. Rest in on the ground and enjoy the tranquillity. I think its time to go home, so you make your way back to the time machine 
                say good bye to your friend and on to new adventures!
